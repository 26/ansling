Important Concepts
==================

Ansling is not a programming language. It is a domain-specific language
for string manipulation. Its syntax differs wildly from what you have seen before.

Expressions
-----------

An Ansling program is one large expression. The result of this expression is returned
to the user. Since Ansling is one expression, it also does have user-defined variables.

Prefix notation
---------------

Lets try entering `3 * "foo"`. It'll be `foofoofoo`, right?

.. code-block:: text

   -- TOO MANY ARGUMENTS --------------------------------------------------------------

   The number of arguments supplied are more than I expected. That's all I know.

   Hint: Check the parameters required for each command on `https://ansling.github.io`.
