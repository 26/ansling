Ansling can be useful to many people because of its simplicity and broad use-case. Let's look at the most important groups.

Developers
**********
Ansling is a productive tool for many developers. It enables programmers to write extremely concise programs to define
regular text patterns or to analyse user input in an efficient and effective way. It can be useful to transform data files or
produce formatted text, as well as to analyse user input to make sure it matches certain criteria.

Because of Ansling simplicity, its source code can easily be generated by other programs and subsequently be executed,
extending its usefulness.

Researchers

Ansling can be used to quickly generate structured reports or transform data structures. It helps researchers format raw
data into a human-readable form or transform one data-structure to another in an efficient and concise way.
