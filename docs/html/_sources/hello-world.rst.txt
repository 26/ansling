Hello, World!
=============

A customary introduction to any programming language is the classic "Hello, World!" program. Such a program
consists of printing the words "Hello, World!" to an output buffer. So without further ado, lets write our
first program:

.. code-block:: ansling

   "Hello, World!"

When we execute this program, the result should look something like this:

.. code-block:: text

   Hello, World!

As you might have noticed, there is no print statement in the program. This is because printing is implicit
in Ansling, therefore the result of the main expression (in this case, the string "Hello, World!") is always
printed.
